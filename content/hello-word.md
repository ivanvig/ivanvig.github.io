# Hello internet!

If you have reached this post I'm sorry for you, because you will not find
anything interesting here. This is only a test post, but in the future may or
may not be more interesting posts mostly about low level computer stuff like
digital design, computer architecture, compilers, operative systems and why not
some AI/ML and digital communications.
